by Wes Bos

Site: [https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/)

Start: 25/04/2022

## 01. JavaScript Drum Kit

**Day 1:** 25/04/2022

- tutorial, code along, put javascript code in separate file
- reorganized and documented code
- replaced the deprecated `e.keyCode` with `e.key`, this also required replacing the ASCII code in the `data_key` attribute, with the corresponding lower case letter in the HTML file

**Day 2:** 26/04/2022

Looking up the CSS properties `transition`, `transform`, `text-shadow`, and `box-shadow`, because I had never used them before. Don't have an immediate use for them in my personal projects, but worth looking into.

**Total Time**: close to 2 hours.

## 02. JS and CSS Clock

**Day 2:** 26/04/2022

- tutorial, code along, put js and css in separate files, gave the hands different colors
- reorganized and documented code

The JavaScript is pretty straightforward. It's the CSS that I find the hardest as I had never worked with transformations before. Stop the course and have an in depth look at the more advanced CSS stuff like transformations, or accept the CSS stuff as given and focus on the Javascript? Focus on the JS!

**Total Time**: almost one hour

## 03. CSS Variables

**Day 3:** 27/04/2022

- tutorial, code along
- moved `<style>` from `<body>` to `<head>`

Third coding challenge and I am learning more CSS than JS. ;-)

**Total Time**: half an hour

## 04. Array Cardio Day 1

**Day 4:** 28/04/2022

- tutorial, code along

Hard to do when you're not very familiar with the array functions `map` and `reduce`, but good reference material.

**Total Time**: almost 2 hours
