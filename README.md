Start: 25/04/2022

## 01. JavaScript Drum Kit

**Day 1:** 25/04/2022

- tutorial, code along, put javascript code in separate file
- reorganized and documented code
- replaced the deprecated `e.keyCode` with `e.key`, this also required replacing the ASCII code in the `data_key` attribute, with the corresponding lower case letter in the HTML file

**Day 2:** 26/04/2022

Looking up the CSS properties `transition`, `transform`, `text-shadow`, and `box-shadow`, because I had never used them before. Don't have an immediate use for them in my personal projects, but worth looking into.

**Total Time**: close to 2 hours.
